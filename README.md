# Heimdall

### Status: Very alpha, and WIP. The following docs may be uncomplete. Feel free to open PR's if something is missing. 

## Features:

- An extensible hotkey daemon which supports multiple modifiers, and custom commands.

## Installation
To get started, simply clone the whole repository, and build it with Rust:

    $ cargo install heimdall-cli


## Getting started
To get started with Heimdall, follow these steps:

1. Create a config file with the path `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/heimdall/config.toml`
    The config file has the following format:
    ```toml
   [[bindings]]
    key = "C"
    modifiers = ["Ctrl", "Shift"]
    command = "echo hello"
    [[bindings]]
    key = "D"
    modifiers = ["Ctrl"]
    command = "osascript -e 'display notification  with title \"Hello ðŸ‘‹!\" subtitle \"Hello from Heimdall ðŸ˜Š\" sound name \"Crystal\"'"
```

2. Start heimdall with the `heim` command. If you want to start the service
    $ heim --start-service
